# Bio

A scribbler at heart who loves UX Design, Graphic Design and Writing, I strive for aesthetic & functional designs that amplify human connections.

A junior in the Bachelor of Information @ UofT. I always start my designs with a ballpoint pen, sketching blue lines and dots first. Sincerely, I think all good designs begin with a small, minute detail! This is reflected in my work and projects, especially my experiences in User Experience Design, Graphic Design, Visual Design, Writing, Branding and Social Media Marketing!
