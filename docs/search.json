I always start my designs with a ballpoint pen, sketching blue lines and dots first. Sincerely, I think all good designs begin with a small, minute detail! This is reflected in my work and projects, especially my experiences in User Experience Design, Graphic Design, Visual Design, Writing, Branding and Social Media Marketing!"
