## Xin ch√†o! 

My name is Quang Mai,  an aspiring UX Designer with a background in Graphic Design. I strive for aesthetic & functional designs that amplify human connections! In my free time, you can catch me watching Tsai Ming-liang's Vive l'amour, skimming Dribbble for UX inspirations and reading Wikipedia entries.
